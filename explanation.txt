Sure! Let's go through the code step by step to understand its functionality.

Import Statements:

The necessary import statements are included at the beginning of each file to import required classes and annotations.
TutorialController:

This class is annotated with @RestController, indicating that it is a RESTful controller that handles HTTP requests and returns responses.
The @CrossOrigin annotation allows cross-origin requests from any origin by default. It enables the API to be accessed by clients from different domains.
The @RequestMapping annotation specifies the base URL ("/api") for all the endpoints in this controller.
Dependencies and Autowiring:

The TutorialController class has a dependency on the TutorialRepository interface, which is autowired using the @Autowired annotation. This allows the controller to use the repository to interact with the database.
Endpoint Definitions:

getAllTutorials: This method handles the GET request to retrieve all tutorials. It accepts an optional query parameter "title" to filter tutorials based on the title. It retrieves tutorials from the repository and returns a response entity with the tutorials and an appropriate HTTP status.
getTutorialById: This method handles the GET request to retrieve a tutorial by its ID. It receives the ID as a path variable, fetches the corresponding tutorial from the repository, and returns a response entity with the tutorial or a NOT_FOUND status if the tutorial doesn't exist.
createTutorial: This method handles the POST request to create a new tutorial. It receives the tutorial data in the request body, saves it to the repository, and returns a response entity with the created tutorial and a CREATED status.
updateTutorial: This method handles the PUT request to update an existing tutorial. It receives the tutorial ID as a path variable and the updated tutorial data in the request body. It fetches the existing tutorial from the repository, updates its fields, saves the changes, and returns a response entity with the updated tutorial or a NOT_FOUND status if the tutorial doesn't exist.
deleteTutorial: This method handles the DELETE request to delete a tutorial by its ID. It receives the tutorial ID as a path variable, deletes the tutorial from the repository, and returns a response entity with a NO_CONTENT status.
deleteAllTutorials: This method handles the DELETE request to delete all tutorials. It deletes all tutorials from the repository and returns a response entity with a NO_CONTENT status.
findByPublished: This method handles the GET request to retrieve all published tutorials. It fetches the published tutorials from the repository and returns a response entity with the tutorials or a NO_CONTENT status if no tutorials are published.
Tutorial Entity:

The Tutorial class is annotated with @Entity to indicate that it is a JPA entity and will be mapped to a database table.
The @Table annotation specifies the name of the table in the database ("tutorials").
The class has fields representing the properties of a tutorial: id, title, description, and published. The fields are annotated with @Column to map them to table columns.
TutorialRepository:

The TutorialRepository interface extends the JpaRepository interface, which provides CRUD operations and other common database operations for the Tutorial entity.
Additional methods are defined in the interface to retrieve tutorials based on specific criteria, such as findByPublished and findByTitleContaining.
DemoApplication:

This class is the entry point of the Spring Boot application.
It is annotated with @SpringBootApplication, which enables auto-configuration and component scanning.
That's a high-level overview of the code. The provided code sets up a Spring Boot application with a RESTful API for managing tutorials. It includes CRUD operations, filtering by title, and retrieving published tutorials. The Tutorial class represents the tutorial entity, and the TutorialRepository interface provides methods to interact with the database.
